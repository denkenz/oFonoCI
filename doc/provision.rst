Carrier Settings Provisioning Database
======================================

Carrier settings provisioning is performed automatically whenever a new,
not previously used SIM card is detected for the first time.  Settings such as
APN, username, password settings as well as the default bearer settings can be
provisioned automatically if a matching database entry is found.

Matches are performed based on the following information:
    * SIM Mobile Country Code (MCC)
    * SIM Mobile Network Code (MNC)
    * SIM Service Provider Name (SPN)

The carrier settings provisioning database is represented in JSON format and is
converted to a binary format at installation time.

Referencing standards in the source
===================================

When referencing standard documents use raw numbers xx.xxx for 3GPP
documents or xxx.xxx for ETSI document (eg: 23.040). If needing to
point to an specific section/subsection, explicitly say "Section foo"

3GPP specs can be found in http://3gpp.org/ftp/Specs.

Core 3GPP Specifications
========================

- 22.030: Man-Machine Interface (MMI) of the User Equipment (UE)

Describes the various supplementary service magic strings, how Abbreviated
Dialing Numbers are used and general UI interaction.  This spec is
particularly important for its description of how calls are put on hold,
transferred, swapped, etc.

- 22.038: Alphabets and Language Specific Information

Describes the GSM 7-bit character set, bit packing for SMS, CBS and USSD.
Also describes UCS2 and how it is encoded for SMS, CBS and USSD.

- 27.007: AT command set for User Equipment (UE)

Describes the AT command set for all GSM modems.  oFono atom driver APIs are
largely based on the AT commands defined in this document.

- 27.005: Short Message Service (SMS) & Cell Broadcast Service (CBS)

Describes the AT command set for SMS and CBS interaction.

- 23.040: Technical realization of the Short Message Service (SMS)

Describes the SMS service in detail, including the various PDUs, headers,
EMS messages, MWI messages and other aspects of SMS.

- 23.041: Technical realization of Cell Broadcast Service (CBS)

Describes the CBS service in detail, including the PDU structure, ETWS and
other aspects.

- 31.102: Characteristics of the (USIM) application

Describes the contents of the SIM, SIM initialization procedures, elementary
file permissions and formats.

- 31.111: Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) Application Toolkit (USAT)

Describes 3GPP specific aspects of Card Application Toolkit (CAT) / STK.

- 31.124: USAT conformance test specification

Describes the testing parameters and test cases for 31.111.


Security Specifications
=======================

- 33.220  Generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA)

Describes the generic bootstrapping architecture used to leverage
SIM-based authentication.

- 24.109  Bootstrapping interface (Ub) and NAF interface (Ua)

Describes how the GBA authentication is used with, e.g., HTTP.


3GPP Specific Services
======================

- 22.072: Call Deflection
- 22.081: Line Identification
- 22.082: Call Forwarding
- 22.083: Call Waiting and Call Hold
- 22.084: Multiparty (MPTY)
- 22.085: Closed User Group
- 22.086: Advice of Charge
- 22.088: Call Barring
- 22.090: Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)
- 22.091: Explicit Call Transfer


ETSI Card Application Toolkit (Sim Toolkit)
===========================================

- 102.223: Card Application Toolkit (CAT)

Describes the core functionality of CAT, but does not describe network
technology specific features (e.g. UMTS/CDMA).

- 102.384: Card Application Toolkit (CAT) conformance specification

Describes test methodology and test cases for 102.223.


Common PCN Handset Specification (CPHS)
=======================================

This specification includes certain pre-standard extensions to GSM
standards. oFono implements some of the features found in the Phase 2
specification, version 4.2.

The specification itself is not publicly available.

Bluetooth Specifications
========================
- Dial-up Networking Profile - Bluetooth specification version 1.1 - 22 February 2001
